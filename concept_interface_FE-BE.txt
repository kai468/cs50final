TODO: app.py should always check if chupochess response is valid, if not -> send error! 
TODO: should we differentiate between a critical error (game is messed up -> EOG) and an uncritical error (retry)?
TODO: app.py should keep a log of invalid FE requests (and error responses)

known usecases:
    0) user starts the game
        Request:    requestType = getBoard; src = 255; tar = 255
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = NULL
    1) user selects piece 
        Request:    requestType = getBoard; src = selected piece; tar = 255
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = List; eogMessage = NULL; notification = NULL
    2) user makes move
        Request:    requestType = getBoard; src = selected piece; tar = selected target
        a) valid move, no end-of-game:
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = NULL
        b) valid move, end-of-game:
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = winner/draw; notification = NULL
        c) no valid move -> return valid moves for selected target square, if applicable:
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = List/NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = NULL
    3) user unmakes move
        Request:    requestType = unmakeMove; src = 255; tar = 255
        a) positive
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = NULL
        b) negative (we're already back in the starting position)
        Reponse:    pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = UNMAKE_IMPOSSIBLE
    4) user suggests draw
        Request:    requestType = drawRequest; src = 255; tar = 255
        a) positive
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = DRAW; notification = NULL
        b) negative
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = NULL; notification = DRAW_REJECTED
    5) user gives up
        Request:    requestType = surrender; src = 255; tar = 255
        Response:   pieces; validMoves = NULL; eogMessage = BLACK_WINS; notification = NULL
    6) Pawn Promotion -> not considered for now; probably there has to be some ping pong (FE requests if move is valid
        -> if it is, FE shows selection field for Queen, Knight, [Rook, Bishop], FE sends selected target piece to BE,
        from there on it's the same as a normal response to makeMove)
