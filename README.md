This is my final project for the CS50 course at Harvard University.

Some time ago I started programming a chess application with pygame to get a bit
deeper into the basic concepts of Python. You can find the repository here: https://github.com/kai468/chupochess
It is a basic chess engine covering (nearly) all of the games'rules. So far there are no computer
opponents involved and you can just play against yourself with both colors (or take turns with 
a friend). 

For this project, however, I will try to step the whole thing up a notch, freely reusing features and
code from the old project, but with the following main goals:
- Implementation as a WebApp (with flask) instead of pygame UI
- a real computer opponent, diving into the concepts of AI with Python
